## <b> Projects Overview:
  
> Hand Tracking:
  >
  >* This project tracks hand movements in real-time using a webcam. It can be used for various applications such as virtual touch screens, gaming, and gesture recognition.

> Pose Estimation: 
  >
  >* This project estimates human poses in real-time using a webcam. It can be used for applications such as fitness tracking, gesture recognition, and virtual reality.

> Face Detection: 
  >
  >* This project detects faces in images and videos using OpenCV's built-in Haar Cascade Classifier. It can be used for various applications such as surveillance, face recognition, and emotion detection.

> Gesture Volume Control: 
  >
  >* This project uses hand gestures to control the volume of a computer. It can be used for various applications such as music playback, video playback, and presentations.

> Hand Finger Counter: 
  >
  >* This project counts the number of fingers held up in front of a webcam in real-time. It can be used for various applications such as sign language recognition, virtual keyboards, and gaming.

> AI Virtual Trainer: 
  >
  >* This project provides real-time feedback on a user's exercise form using computer vision. It can be used for various fitness applications such as yoga, weightlifting, and stretching.
