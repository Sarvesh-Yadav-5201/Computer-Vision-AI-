Can you wrtie the steps required to create a virtual mouse using Open Cv , mediapipe and pyautogui.

I dont want you to write  a code . Just he steps in bullte points?

## Genie

Sure, here are the steps required to create a virtual mouse using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pyautogui:

1. Install the necessary packages such as OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pyautogui in your environment.
2. Capture the video frames using OpenCV VideoCapture.
3. Apply hand detection on each frame of the video using Mediapipe.
4. Extract the landmarks of the detected hand using Mediapipe.
5. Track the movement of the landmarks of the hand over time to calculate the change in position of the hand.
6. Map the change in position of the hand to the corresponding change in position of the mouse cursor.
7. Use Pyautogui to move the mouse cursor to the updated position.
8. Add functionality to capture hand gestures and perform appropriate actions such as left-click, right-click, scroll, etc.
9. Test the implementation and adjust the parameters such as detection threshold, mapping sensitivity, and gesture recognition as necessary. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

alryt .. i want to add  the functionality of left click , right click and scrolling up and down. Can you write the detailed steps involved in that?

## Genie

Sure! Here are the steps involved in adding functionality for left-click, right-click, and scrolling up and down:

1. For left-click functionality, check if the user's thumb tip landmark is to the left of their index finger tip landmark. If so, use PyAutoGUI's `click()` function to perform a left-click at the current cursor position.

2. For right-click functionality, check if the user's thumb tip landmark is to the right of their index finger tip landmark. If so, use PyAutoGUI's `rightClick()` function to perform a right-click at the current cursor position.

3. For scrolling functionality, calculate the difference in Y-axis position between the current frame and the previous frame. If the difference is positive, use PyAutoGUI's `scroll()` function to scroll up. If the difference is negative, use the same function to scroll down.

4. Add these functionalities to the main loop that runs continuously as long as the webcam is on and hand detection is working. Make sure to handle exceptions appropriately and add delays to avoid performing clicks and scrolls too frequently.

5. Test the implementation and tweak the parameters as necessary.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
